# JPA
Save entity into DB using Derby. Example using Java SE (there is no container that manages the DB connection)
- Two packages. One has the entity(employee) class and the other creates a new employee.
- You have to load the eclipselink jars (in this case, there are others like hibernate...).
- The example uses derby. It is important to build the jars (derby-client.jar and so on).
- Don't forget to set up as well the persistence.xml file.
