# JPA
Save entity into DB using Derby
- Two packages. One has the entity(employee) class and the other creates a new employee.
- You have to load the eclipselink jars (in this case).
- Using derby is also important to build also the jars (derby-client.jar and so on).
- Don't forget to set up as well the persistence.xml file.
